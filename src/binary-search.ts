// questions for datasets
// 1. Is it ordered?
//      If it's ordered, you have new options for searching

// [            ]
//  0          N
// ---X0 = V?
// you don't have to do this
// you don't have to start at the first position, then the next, etc

// instead, do half at a time
// if its larger or smaller, do the left half or right half
// continue halfing your dataset until you get to V
// O(logN)
